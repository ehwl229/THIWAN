                <p>
                    Thi Wan, 21, was born in Burma, and grew up in Brooklyn. Initially hoping to pursue a career in scientific research like his parents did, Wan instead decided to enter the field of art and design after being offered a full scholarship to Parsons scholars program at the age of 15. In his earlier years, he explored product design, architecture, and fine arts. During this time, he also assisted local sculptors from whom he gained knowledge in material experimentation. Later,he channeled all of this into Communication Design where he focused on studying art direction and Fashion Design with a focus on menswear, while interning and freelancing for fashion designers outside, eventually getting to work on projects for celebrities like Lady Gaga, and the Black Eyed Peas. His unique knowledge of materials allowed him particular success in the field of accessories, bringing a selection of projects into light through NYFW, Vogue Italia, and other media.
